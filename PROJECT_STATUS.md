# Project Status - Drone Hunter Game

## Overview
A first-person shooter game where players hunt down drones in an urban environment. The game features realistic physics, dynamic weather, and engaging gameplay mechanics.

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Player Movement System**
   - WASD movement with physics-based controls
   - Sprint functionality (SHIFT)
   - Jump mechanics (SPACE)
   - Head bobbing for realistic movement
   - Collision detection with buildings and environment

2. **Combat System**
   - Shooting mechanics with instant tracers
   - Bullet physics and hit detection
   - Enhanced explosion effects for drone destruction
   - Ammo management and reload system (R key)
   - Score tracking based on distance of shots

3. **Environment**
   - Urban setting with procedurally placed buildings
   - Collision detection for buildings
   - Dynamic lighting system
   - Trees and mountains in the distance
   - Atmospheric effects (clouds, fog)

4. **Drone System**
   - AI-controlled drone movement
   - Drone spawning and management
   - Hit detection and destruction effects
   - Various drone types with different behaviors

5. **UI/HUD**
   - Ammo counter
   - Score display
   - Reload indicator
   - Achievement system
   - Control hints

## Key Files and Their Purposes

### Core Game Components
- `app/game/components/Player.tsx`: Player movement, physics, and camera controls
- `app/game/components/Weapon.tsx`: Weapon handling and shooting mechanics
- `app/game/components/weapon/BulletSystem.tsx`: Bullet physics, tracers, and hit detection
- `app/game/components/DroneSystem.tsx`: Drone spawning and behavior management
- `app/game/components/Environment.tsx`: Game world, buildings, and scenery
- `app/game/components/GameUI.tsx`: HUD and user interface elements

### State Management
- `app/game/store.ts`: Global game state management (scores, ammo, achievements)

### Effects and Utilities
- `app/game/components/effects/WeatherEffects.tsx`: Weather system and atmospheric effects
- `app/game/components/collision/CollisionManager.ts`: Collision detection system

## Recent Updates
1. Fixed building collision detection to prevent walking through objects
2. Enhanced explosion effects for drone destruction
3. Improved bullet tracer system with 2-second duration
4. Optimized performance for smoother gameplay
5. Added proper cleanup for effects and resources

## Current Focus
- Improving hit detection reliability
- Enhancing visual feedback for hits
- Optimizing performance
- Polishing game mechanics

## Known Issues
1. Occasional stuttering when shooting drones
2. Some linter errors in BulletSystem.tsx need addressing:
   - Type definitions for lights array
   - onHit callback reference in update method

## Future Improvements
1. Add more drone types and behaviors
2. Implement power-ups and special weapons
3. Add sound effects and music
4. Create a level progression system
5. Add more achievements and rewards

## Development Guidelines
1. Always implement proper cleanup for Three.js objects
2. Use proper typing for TypeScript components
3. Maintain performance by reusing geometries and materials
4. Follow the established component structure
5. Test changes in both development and production builds

## Quick Start for Development
1. Key files to modify for common tasks:
   - Player mechanics: `Player.tsx`
   - Weapon mechanics: `Weapon.tsx` and `BulletSystem.tsx`
   - Drone behavior: `DroneSystem.tsx`
   - Environment: `Environment.tsx`
   - UI changes: `GameUI.tsx`

2. Testing changes:
   - Run the development server
   - Test performance in production build
   - Verify collision detection
   - Check for memory leaks

## Dependencies
- Next.js
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- Zustand for state management
- ShadCN UI components
